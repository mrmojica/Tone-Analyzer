# Tone-Analyzer

The Tone Analyzer project uses the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API.  The application we are creating allows users to see how their text messages might be perceived by the end user.  Emotions can be identified (example: anger, fear, joy, sadness, and disgust) and social tendencies can be identified (ex: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional range).  

Some of the common uses for the application would be to get feedback about the way you communicate through analyzing emails, text messages, and chat logs.  Once the user receives feedback they can fine-tune their writing or tone to their liking.
